## Contributing

1. Please read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
2. Create a new issue before starting your project so that we can keep track of
   what you are trying to add/fix. That way, we can also offer suggestions or
   let you know if there is already an effort in progress.
3. Fork this repository.
4. [Build the plugin locally](#build)
5. Create a _topic_ branch in your fork. Note, this step is recommended but technically not required if contributing using a fork.
6. Edit the code in your fork.
7. Write appropriate tests for your changes. Try to achieve at least 95% code coverage on any new code. No pull request will be accepted without unit tests.
8. Send us a pull request when you are done. We'll review your code, suggest any needed changes, and merge it in.

### Build

To build the plugin locally, make sure to have yarn installed and run the following commands:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:SimplySF/simply-package

# Install the dependencies and compile
yarn && yarn build
```

To use your plugin, run using the local `./bin/dev` or `./bin/dev.cmd` file.

```bash
# Run using local run file.
./bin/dev.cmd simply package
```

There should be no differences when running via the Salesforce CLI or using the local run file. However, it can be useful to link the plugin to do some additional testing or run your commands from anywhere on your machine.

```bash
# Link your plugin to the sf cli
sf plugins link .
# To verify
sf plugins
```

DESCRIPTION
  Install package dependencies for a Salesforce project.

  Installs all specified package dependencies in a Salesforce DX project using the sfdx-project.json definition.

EXAMPLES
  $ sf simply package dependencies install --target-org myTargetOrg --target-dev-hub myTargetDevHub

  $ sf simply package dependencies install --target-org myTargetOrg --target-dev-hub myTargetDevHub --installation-key "MyPackage1Alias:MyPackage1Key"

  $ sf simply package dependencies install --target-org myTargetOrg --target-dev-hub myTargetDevHub --installation-key "MyPackage1Alias:MyPackage1Key" --installation-key "MyPackage2Alias:MyPackage2Key"

FLAG DESCRIPTIONS
  -a, --apex-compile=all|package

    Compile all Apex in the org and package, or only Apex in the package; unlocked packages only.

    Applies to unlocked packages only. Specifies whether to compile all Apex in the org and package, or only the Apex in
    the package.

    For package installs into production orgs, or any org that has Apex Compile on Deploy enabled, the platform compiles
    all Apex in the org after the package install or upgrade operation completes.

    This approach assures that package installs and upgrades donâ€™t impact the performance of an org, and is done even if
    --apex-compile package is specified.

  -i, --install-type=All|Delta  Install all packages or only deltas.

    If 'All' is specified, then all packages specified in package dependencies are installed, regardless of if the
    version already is installed in the org. If 'Delta' is specified, then only packages that differ from what is
    installed in the org will be installed.

  -k, --installation-key=<value>...  Installation key for key-protected packages

    Installation key for key-protected packages in the key:value format of SubscriberPackageVersionId:Key

  -r, --no-prompt  Don't prompt for confirmation.

    Allows the following without an explicit confirmation response: 1) Remote Site Settings and Content Security Policy
    websites to send or receive data, and 2) --upgrade-type Delete to proceed.

  -t, --upgrade-type=DeprecateOnly|Mixed|Delete

    Upgrade type for the package installation; available only for unlocked packages.

    For package upgrades, specifies whether to mark all removed components as deprecated (DeprecateOnly), to delete
    removed components that can be safely deleted and deprecate the others (Mixed), or to delete all removed components,
    except for custom objects and custom fields, that don't have dependencies (Delete). The default is Mixed. Can
    specify DeprecateOnly or Delete only for unlocked package upgrades.

  -z, --branch=<value>  Package branch to consider when specifiying a Package/VersionNumber combination

    For dependencies specified by Package/VersionNumber combination, you can specify the branch group of builds to work
    from by entering the branch build name. If not specified, the builds from NULL branch will be considered.
